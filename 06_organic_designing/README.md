# 6. Organic Designing

## Aim
To design a hollow vase for MARVEL using the Forms feature in Fusion 360, and to learn how organic, freeform shapes are built with T-spline modelling.

## Design brief
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base width/diameter | 70 mm |
| Aperture (opening) | 55 mm |
| Wall thickness | 2 mm |

## Background

### Organic design and Forms
Organic shapes are smooth, flowing and free of sharp straight edges, like plants, shells and pottery. They are hard to build from sketches and extrudes. The **Forms** workspace models with T-splines: you start with a simple shape (a box, cylinder or sphere) and push, pull, scale and rotate its faces, edges and vertices, and Fusion keeps the surface smooth.

### Key ideas
- **Control mesh:** the cage of faces, edges and vertices that you edit.
- **Edit Form:** moves, rotates and scales selected faces, edges or vertices.
- **Symmetry:** lets you edit one part of the form and have the rest follow, which keeps repeating shapes even.
- **Thicken:** turns a surface into a solid wall of a set thickness.

## Design
The vase has a round body with a scalloped surface: rounded vertical lobes repeat around its circumference, which gives it a soft, flowing look from every side. The top has a round opening and the inside is hollow.

The top view shows the scalloped outline of the outer wall and the round opening, with the hollow inside and the base at the bottom.

The isometric view shows the vertical lobes running from the base to the rim, and the opening at the top.

## Steps
1. Create a construction plane (`Plane1`) to position the shape.
2. Draw the base and opening sketches (`Sketch1` to `Sketch4`) with the 70 mm base and 55 mm aperture.
3. Create the form in the Form workspace from a basic cylinder and shape it into the scalloped body by editing its faces and edges.
4. Use symmetry or a repeated pattern so that the lobes are identical all the way round.
5. Finish the form and give the surface a 2 mm wall using Thicken, so the vase is hollow.
6. Use Inspect > Section Analysis (`Section1`) to cut through the vase and check that the wall is hollow and 2 mm thick.

## Notes
- A cylinder with a few edits gives a smooth organic body much faster than lofting many sketches.
- Symmetry keeps all the lobes the same, so the vase looks balanced.
- The section analysis is a quick way to check wall thickness without changing the model.
- The wall thickness matters if the vase is to be 3D printed. A 2 mm wall is thick enough to print and light enough to save material.
- What this task covers: the Forms workspace, editing T-spline bodies, symmetry, thickening a surface and checking a design with section analysis.
