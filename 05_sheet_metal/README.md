# 5. Sheet Metal

## Aim
To design a part for MARVEL in the Sheet Metal environment of Fusion 360 and to understand how a flat metal sheet is bent into a finished part. The design is judged on usability, compatibility, creativity, optimization and resource use.

## Background

### Sheet metal environment
Sheet metal parts are made by cutting and bending a flat sheet of constant thickness. Fusion 360 has a dedicated Sheet Metal tab that works with a **sheet metal rule**, which stores the material, thickness, bend radius and bend allowance (K-factor). Every flange and bend follows this rule, so the part can always be unfolded into an accurate flat pattern.

### Key terms
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Sheet metal rule | Settings for material, thickness, bend radius and K-factor |
| Flange | A bent-up wall added to the edge of a sheet |
| Bend | The curved region where the sheet folds |
| Bend relief | A small cut at a bend so the metal does not tear |
| Flat pattern | The part unfolded into a single flat sheet, used for cutting |
| Refold | Returns the flat pattern view back to the folded part |

## Design
The part is a **laptop stand** made from one sheet of aluminium (rule: Aluminum (mm)).

- A sloped top plate holds the laptop at an angle.
- Two side walls support the plate and hold it at the slope.
- Round holes are cut across the top plate and the side walls for ventilation and to save material.
- The part is a single body (`Body1`).

## Flat pattern
The finished part is unfolded with **Create Flat Pattern**. The result is one flat piece with all the holes and bend edges, ready for laser cutting and bending.

The top plate is in the middle with the two side walls on either side, and small tabs at the bottom edge. Clicking **Refold** in the toolbar returns the model to its folded shape.

## Steps
1. Open the Sheet Metal tab and select the sheet metal rule (Aluminum (mm)).
2. Sketch the base profile of the sloped plate and create the first face.
3. Add flanges to build the side walls from the plate edges, using the same rule for thickness and bend radius.
4. Add bend reliefs and corner shaping where the walls meet.
5. Cut the holes on the top plate and the side walls using sketches and a pattern.
6. Create the flat pattern and check that all holes, bends and tabs unfold correctly.
7. Use Refold to return to the folded model.

## Notes
- The whole stand comes from a single flat sheet, which keeps material use and the number of parts low (optimization and resource).
- The ventilation holes keep the laptop cool and make the stand lighter (usability).
- The sloped plate puts the laptop at an angle for typing (usability and compatibility).
- Working with a sheet metal rule makes sure the flat pattern is dimensionally correct, so what is cut flat folds into the right size.
- What this task covers: sheet metal rules, flanges and bends, hole patterns, flat patterns and refolding in Fusion 360.
